        **Note**: Some *nix distributions patch {{cookiecutter.pkg_name}} arbitrarily to
        accommodate incompatible software versions. If you're on one of those
        distributions, your issue may be closed and you will be asked to open
        an issue with your distribution package maintainers instead.
