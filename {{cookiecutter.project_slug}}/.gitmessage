# Commitizen and Python Semantic Release require the following:
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Each commit message consists of a header, a body and a footer.
# The header has a special format that includes a type, a scope and a subject:

# <type>(<scope>): <subject>
# <BLANK LINE>
# <body>
# <BLANK LINE>
# <footer>

# The header is mandatory and the scope of the header is optional.

# - Revert -
# If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with revert: , followed by
# the header of the reverted commit. In the body it should say: This reverts
# commit <hash>., where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.

# - Type -
# feat: A new feature
# fix: A bug fix
# docs: Documentation only changes
# style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting..)
# refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
# perf: A code change that improves performance
# test: Adding missing or correcting existing tests
# chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries etc.

# - Scope -
# The scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change.
# You can use * when the change affects more than a single scope.

# - Subject -
# contains succinct description of the change:
# use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
# don't capitalize first letter
# no dot (.) at the end

# - Body -
# Just as in the subject, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor
# "changes". The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with
# previous behavior.

# - Footer -
# The footer should contain any information about Breaking Changes and is also the
# place to reference issues that this commit closes.
# e.g. Closes #123, #245, #992
# Breaking Changes should start with the word BREAKING CHANGE: with a space or two
# newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.

{% else %}
#
# 1.Separate subject from body with a blank line
# 2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
# 3. Capitalize the subject line
# 4. Do not end the subject line with a period
# 5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
# 6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
# 7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

# At the end: Include Co-authored-by for all contributors.
# Include at least one empty line before it. Format:
# Co-authored-by: name <user@users.noreply.github.com>
